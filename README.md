# UVT Challenge

This is an application built in jQuery.

## Running the Application

1. Clone the repository and open the index.html in a Chrome or Firefox browser.
2. Use the input fields to enter minutes, seconds (both limited to 2 digits), and milliseconds.
3. Click Submit.
4. Press the play button to start.
5. The thumb on the range can be moved around to start at different locations, but play cannot be active.
5. While 'playing' the UVT visual and numeric displays will auto update.


## Testing

I was not sure how to write automated tests for some of the code I wrote and was running out of time. I wrote tests for what I could. These can be found at the bottom of the jquery.js file and would need to be uncommented for use. In the code that I could not write tests for I left console logs that could be uncommented to see what is being produced when bugs are found.
